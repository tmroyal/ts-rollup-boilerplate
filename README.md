# TS Rollup Boilerplate

This is an extremely minimal boilerplate I created for myself
to allow for experimentation with typescript using rollup. 

It relies on the following:

- typescript
- rollup
- tsclib
- @rollup/plugin-typescript

It uses typescript output to esnext modules, per the requirements of the typescript plugin. 

There are two scripts:

- ``build``
- ``clean``

I made this for myself. No support is implied.
